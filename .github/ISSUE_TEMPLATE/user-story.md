The phrase "If the train system improves in Costa Rica, will more people choose it instead of driving?" is a grammatically correct example of a conditional sentence

The conditional  is used to talk about real and possible situations in the future. It has a specific structure:

* If + simple present tense (the condition)
* Simple future tense (the result)

Therefore

* Condition: "If the train system *improves*" (simple present tense)
* Result: "*will* more people *choose* it" (simple future tense)

This structure correctly expresses a probable outcome (more people choosing the train) if a specific condition is met (the train system improving).

The sentence is also a question and it has the correct  structure to form a question in the future tense.
